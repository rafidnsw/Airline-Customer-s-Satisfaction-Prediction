# Airline-Customer-s-Satisfaction-Prediction
Final Project of my data science course in Rakamin Academy. The project regarding creation of machine learning prediction model through supervised learning: classification

Data used in this project can be categorized into to category, `personal information` and `ratings`. The project consists of several methodically steps in creating machine learning model:
### Problem Statement
In this first section, we bring up the problem within the company that the data given from. There are 3 points we'd like to emphasize, the objectives, metrics & goals in this project
### Data Pre-processing
The second section includes preparation methods and also several processing treatments toward the data. For the preparation, we mainly define the data, look for missing & duplicate values. While in the processing, we engineered the data using actions such like creating new feature, replacing some value, encoding categorical value, etc.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
In this EDA section we try to find insights that may be useful for our initial purpose. We also visualize most of the features in the data and look for anomalies & supporting facts. We also try to point out outliers in our data, and find the best method to eliminate the outliers without reducing information from the data as optimum as we can.
### Modelling
After done with all the processing and EDA, we now have our data prepared to enter the modelling stage. In this stage we model the prediction using several classification algorithms such as LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest & XGBoost. Metrics evaluation that we use is F1-score since we want to truly see our customer that actually satisfied or dissatisfied from our current services.
### Business Recommendation
From all the steps we took in this project, the final output is to give recommendation based on our findings in this project. There are several things that we recommend, mainly about upgrading the services in the airline. In this section we also tried to simulate the impacts that our recommendation can give to the company.
